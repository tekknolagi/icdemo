A small inline caching demo. The meat is in [interpreter.c](interpreter.c).

Take a look at the [blog post](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching/)
for more information.

Please feel free to submit pull requests with implementations in other
languages, or with the extensions mentioned in the blog post. I'd love to see
them!
